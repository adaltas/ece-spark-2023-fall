Before using it, you need to create an account.

**NOTE:** Databricks offer two trial versions of their platform:
- Community Edition: unlimited time, limited functionality. Hosted on AWS (you don't need to select it yourself).
- Free Trial: 14 days of all functionalities. You can choose the cloud provider. Databricks' service is free, but other resources (VM, storage...) is charged by the cloud provider.

**Pay attention to sign up for Community Edition.** It should never ask you for your credit card details.
